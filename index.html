    <h1>Mouse History</h1>
    <p>A computer mouse is an input device that is often used with a personal computer. Moving a mouse along a flat surface can move the on-screen cursor to different items on the screen. Items can be moved or selected by pressing the mouse buttons.<br>
    It is called a computer mouse because of the wire that connects the mouse to the computer. The people who designed the first computer mice thought that it looked like the tail on a mouse. Today, many computer mice use wireless technology and have no wire.<br>
    Most computer mice has 2 buttons and a scrolling wheel.<br>

    <p>A <strong>Computer Mouse</strong> is an input device that is often used with a personal computer. Moving a mouse along a flat surface can move the on-screen cursor to different items on the screen. Items can be moved or selected by pressing the mouse buttons
    It is called a computer mouse because of the wire that connects the mouse to the computer. The people who designed the first computer mice thought that it looked like the tail on a mouse. Today, many computer mice use wireless technology and have no wire.</p>
    
    
    <p> Long ago, computers had <em>no mouse</em> and <em>no graphical interface</em>. 
      Data was entered by typing command on a keyboard. <br> The mouse was invented by <strong><em>Douglas Engelbart</em></strong> in <em>1964</em>
      and was made up of a <em>wooden shell, circuit board</em> and <em><br> 2 metal wheels</em> that came into contact with the surface it was being used on. <br>
      8 years later (1972), <strong><em>Bill English</em></strong> developed the design by inventing the <em>"Ball Mouse"</em>.<br> The ball replaced the wheels 
    and was capable of monitoring movement in any direction.<br>
    </p>
      
      <p><strong>Types of mouse</strong>
    <ul><strong>Mechanical Mouse (ball mouse)</strong> - In 1972, Bill English (builder of Engelbart’s original mouse) invented the ball mouse, while working for Xerox PARC. In this, a single mouse was replaced by the external wheels, which could roll in any direction.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Optical Mouse</strong> - An optical mouse is an computer pointing device that uses a light-emitting diode an optical sensor, and digital signal processing ( DSP ).This mouse doesn’t have mouse ball and electromechanical transducer. Movement is detected by sensing changes in reflected light, instead of interpreting the motion of a rolling sphere.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Infrared (IR) or radio frequency cordless mouse </strong>- With both these types, the mouse relays a signal to a base station wired to the computer’s mouse port. The cordless mouse requires power, which comes in the form of batteries.</ul>
    <ul><strong>A mouse with many buttons</strong> - The extra buttons can be programmed to do specific things, such as navigate the Web or turn pages when you’re reading a document. The typical button-ified mouse has about five buttons.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Trackball mouse</strong> - A trackball mouse is a pointing device.It consists of a ball held by a socket containing sensors to detect a rotation of the ball. The user rolls the ball with the thumb, fingers, or the palm of the hand to move a pointer.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Stylus mouse</strong> - Another mouse mutation enjoyed by the artistic type is the stylus mouse, which looks like a pen and draws on a special pad.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Cordless 3-D mouse </strong>- This kind of mouse can be pointed at the computer screen like a TV remote.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Wireless mouse</strong> - The Mouse without wire or cord is called wireless mouse or cordless mouse. Most wireless mice use radiofrequency (RF) technology to communicate information to your computer.</ul>
    <ul><strong>GStick mouse</strong> - Gordon Stewart designed the Stick to add a more authentic and natural feel to artistic manipulations on both Macs and PCs. These mice are Wireless and pocket-sized. It looks like a pencil. gStick mouse is like a pencil. It can be used for web browsing, office work or whatever you do with your traditional mouse, with more comfort. It also features a scroll wheel that can be manipulated with a finger or thumb a button on either side of the wheel.
