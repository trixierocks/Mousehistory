    <h1>Mouse History</h1>
    <p> Long ago, computers had <em>no mouse</em> and <em>no graphical interface</em>. 
      Data was entered by typing command on a keyboard. <br> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/SRI_Douglas_Engelbart_2008.jpg/220px-SRI_Douglas_Engelbart_2008.jpg" alt="A picture of 
Douglas Engelbart" width="250px"> The mouse was invented by <strong><em>Douglas Engelbart</em></strong> in <em>1964</em>
      and was made up of a <em>wooden shell, circuit board</em> and <em><br> 2 metal wheels</em> that came into contact with the surface it was being used on. <br>
      8 years later (1972), <strong><em>Bill English</em></strong> developed the design by inventing the <em>"Ball Mouse"</em>.<br> The ball replaced the wheels 
    and was capable of monitoring movement in any direction.<br>
