    <h1> <strong class="maintitle">  Mouse History </strong> </h1>
    <p> Long ago, computers had <em>no mouse</em> and <em>no graphical interface</em>. 
      Data was entered by typing command on a keyboard. The mouse was invented by <strong><em>Douglas Engelbart</em></strong>in <em>1964</em>
      and was made up of a <em>wooden shell, circuit board</em> and <em> 2 metal wheels</em> that came into contact with the surface it was being used on.
      8 years later (1972), <strong><em>Bill English</em></strong> developed the design by inventing the <em>"Ball Mouse"</em>. The ball replaced the wheels 
    and was capable of monitoring movement in any direction.<br>
