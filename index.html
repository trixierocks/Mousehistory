    <h1>Computer Mouse</h1>
  
    <p>A computer mouse is an input device that is often used with a personal computer. Moving a mouse along a flat surface can move the on-screen cursor to different items on the screen. Items can be moved or selected by pressing the mouse buttons.<br>
    It is called a computer mouse because of the wire that connects the mouse to the computer. The people who designed the first computer mice thought that it looked like the tail on a mouse. Today, many computer mice use wireless technology and have no wire.<br>
    Most computer mice has 2 buttons and a scrolling wheel.<br>

     <p>Long ago, computers had <em>no mouse</em> and <em>no graphical interface</em>. 
      Data was entered by typing command on a keyboard. <br> The mouse was invented by <strong><em>Douglas Engelbart</em></strong> in <em>1964</em>
      and was made up of a <em>wooden shell, circuit board</em> and <em><br> 2 metal wheels</em> that came into contact with the surface it was being used on. <br>
      8 years later (1972), <strong><em>Bill English</em></strong> developed the design by inventing the <em>"Ball Mouse"</em>.<br> The ball replaced the wheels 
    and was capable of monitoring movement in any direction.<br>
