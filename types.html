<ul>
<li><strong>Mechanical Mouse (ball mouse)</strong> - In 1972, Bill English (builder of Engelbart’s original mouse) invented the ball mouse, while working for Xerox PARC. In this, a single mouse was replaced by the external wheels, which could roll in any direction.</li>
<li><strong>Optical Mouse</strong> - An optical mouse is an computer pointing device that uses a light-emitting diode an optical sensor, and digital signal processing ( DSP ).This mouse doesn’t have mouse ball and electromechanical transducer. Movement is detected by sensing changes in reflected light, instead of interpreting the motion of a rolling sphere.</li>
<li><strong>Infrared (IR) or radio frequency cordless mouse </strong>- With both these types, the mouse relays a signal to a base station wired to the computer’s mouse port. The cordless mouse requires power, which comes in the form of batteries.</li>
<li><strong>A mouse with many buttons</strong> - The extra buttons can be programmed to do specific things, such as navigate the Web or turn pages when you’re reading a document. The typical button-ified mouse has about five buttons.</li>
<li><strong>Trackball mouse</strong> - A trackball mouse is a pointing device.It consists of a ball held by a socket containing sensors to detect a rotation of the ball. The user rolls the ball with the thumb, fingers, or the palm of the hand to move a pointer.</li>
<li><strong>Stylus mouse</strong> - Another mouse mutation enjoyed by the artistic type is the stylus mouse, which looks like a pen and draws on a special pad.</li>
<li><strong>Cordless 3-D mouse </strong>- This kind of mouse can be pointed at the computer screen like a TV remote.</li>
<li><strong>Wireless mouse</strong> - The Mouse without wire or cord is called wireless mouse or cordless mouse. Most wireless mice use radiofrequency (RF) technology to communicate information to your computer.</li>
<li><strong>GStick mouse</strong> - Gordon Stewart designed the Stick to add a more authentic and natural feel to artistic manipulations on both Macs and PCs. These mice are Wireless and pocket-sized. It looks like a pencil. gStick mouse is like a pencil. It can be used for web browsing, office work or whatever you do with your traditional mouse, with more comfort.
